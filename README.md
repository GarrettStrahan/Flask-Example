# Flask-Example
#Python 3.7
Not serious Flask project but maybe update later with something useful

Flask.py is the main source code you want to run. Right now the pictures are not working with the flask framework, still working on it.
Will come back to this project at some point. Right now learning other frameworks are my main objective.
